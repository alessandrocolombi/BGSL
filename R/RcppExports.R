#' A direct sampler for GWishart distributed random variables.  
#'
#' This function draws a random matrices, distributed according to the G-Wishart distribution with shape parameter b and inverse scale D, 
#' with respect to the graph structure G. METTERE LA FORMULA DELLA DISTRIBUZIONE 
#' It implements the algorithm described by METTERE CITAZIONI LENKOSKI. It works with both decomposable and non decomposable graphs. 
#' In particular it is possible to provide a graph in block form. 
#' @param G Eigen Matrix of unsigned int stored columnwise. If a standard R matrix is provided, it is automaticaly converted. The lower part 
#' is not used, the elements is taken in consideration only if the graph is in block form, i.e if groups is non null.
#' @param b double, it is shape parameter. It has to be larger than 2 in order to have a well defined distribution.
#' @param D Eigen Matrix of double stored columnwise. It has to be symmetric and positive definite. 
#' @param norm Rcpp::String to choose the matrix norm with respect to whom convergence takes place. The available choices are Mean, Inf, One and Squared. Mean is the default value
#' @param groups a Rcpp list representing the groups of the block form. Numerations starts from 0 and vertrices has to be contiguous from group to group, 
#' i.e ((0,1,2),(3,4)) is fine but ((1,2,3), (4,5)) and ((1,3,5), (2,4)) are not. Leave NULL if the graph is not in block form.
#' @param unsigned int, the maximum number of iteration.
#' @param threshold double, the accurancy for checking if the sampled matrix respects the structure of the graph.
#' @param seed int with the value of the seed. Default value is 0 that implies that a random seed is drawn.
#' @return Rcpp::List containing the sampled matrix as an Eigen RowMajor matrix, a bool that states if the convergence was reached or not and finally an int with the number of performed iterations.
#' If the graph is empty or complete, no iterations are performed. It is automatically converted in standard R list.

#' log of GWishart normalizing constant
#'
#' This function computes the logarithm of the normalizing constant of GWishart distribution. It implements the Monte Carlo method, developed by Atay-Kayis and Massam (2005).
#' METTERE LA FORMULA
#' It also works for non decomposable graphs, actually the exact formula for the decomposable case is not yet implemented. 
#' In particular it is possible to provide a graph in block form. 
#' @param G Eigen Matrix of unsigned int stored columnwise. If a standard R matrix is provided, it is automaticaly converted. The lower part 
#' is not used, the elements is taken in consideration only if the graph is in block form, i.e if groups is non null.
#' @param b double, it is shape parameter. It has to be larger than 2 in order to have a well defined distribution.
#' @param D Eigen Matrix of double stored columnwise. It has to be symmetric and positive definite. 
#' @param MCiteration unsigned int, the number of iteration for the MonteCarlo approximation. 
#' @param groups a Rcpp list representing the groups of the block form. Numerations starts from 0 and vertrices has to be contiguous from group to group, 
#' i.e ((0,1,2),(3,4)) is fine but ((1,2,3), (4,5)) and ((1,3,5), (2,4)) are not. Leave NULL if the graph is not in block form.
#' @param seed int with the value of the seed. Default value is 0 that implies that a random seed is drawn.
#' @return long double, the logarithm of the normalizing constant of GWishart distribution.
